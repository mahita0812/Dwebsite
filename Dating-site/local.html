                <h2 >How to meet singles near and the challenges
                    of local dating</h2>
    
                <p>Looking to meet local singles in real life in the U.S.? Here are some of the best places to start:</p>
    
                <ul>
                    <li>If you’re wondering, “are there even singles near me?”, we suggest you go to your local park. It’s a
                        nice casual environment to socialize and see just how many people are single in your area. &nbsp;</li>
    
                    <li>Try to join a local club or organization for people who share your interests. At least you’ll know you
                        have one thing in common.</li>
    
                    <li>A coffee shop is a great place to encounter local singles and can be less socially intense than a
                        bar.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                </ul>
    
                <p>While these are great ways to meet people, there are also some obstacles to making a connection:</p>
    
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Timing</strong> &#8211; You often have to be in the right place at the right time to meet the
                        right person. You might walk into a coffee shop they just walked out of 5 minutes ago.</li>
    
                    <li><strong>Approach</strong> &#8211; Talking to strangers can be daunting. They may already be with someone
                        or not open to a conversation right then.</li>
    
                    <li><strong>Schedules</strong> &#8211; The activities around meeting new people can take time. Many people
                        have other obligations and priorities and can’t save time for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                </ul>
    
                <p>That&#8217;s why so many people looking for singles near me turn to internet dating and specifically to
                    eharmony.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="same">
                <h2 >We help you find meaningful local connections</h2>

                <p>eharmony helps you not just find local singles in the U.S. but singles from all over the world, like Canada,
                    Australia, the U.K and many more. This is mainly because of our high-quality dating member pool of
                    open-minded, inclusive and authentic singles who are looking for a meaningful relationship.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="same">
                <h2 >How eharmony works</h2>

                <p>There are many added features and services on eharmony but your dating journey on our platform basically
                    involves three steps to help you find singles near me:</p>
    
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Upon registration, you’ll be asked to fill out our Compatibility Quiz so we can get to know you better.
                        The results from the Quiz will be compiled into your Personality Profile, which serves as the roadmap
                        for how we match you.</li>
    
                    <li>Your Match List will then fill up with people who we feel you may be compatible with – so explore them
                        in your own time.</li>
    
                    <li>Once you’ve found some people who spark your interest, get in touch and start getting to know them. Once
                        things heat up, you can even have a Video Date right on our platform.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="same">
                <h2 >Filter for singles near you and much more</h2>

                <p>Many local dating sites offer the opportunity to find singles nearby by using an appropriate filter. With
                    eharmony you can filter not only by geographically, but also by criteria such as age, common interests,
                    smokers, desire to have children and much more.&nbsp;</p>
            </div>

           <div class="same">
            <h2>Detailed profiles that get straight to the point</h2>

            <p>When looking for singles near me, one can often opt for impulse on dating apps. eharmony encourages the
                opposite. We provide detailed profiles that share basic biographic information and also really get to the
                heart of the person.</p>

            <p>However, we also believe dating should be fun and light-spirited. Our Lifestyle section, presented as a
                series of visual cards, lets you quickly see where you share similarities in characteristics, interests and
                passions.&nbsp; Because in the end, it&#8217;s not distance that should decide about your happy end on your
                local dating journey, but personality.</p>
           </div>

            <div class="same">
                <h2 >Feel safe while you connect with local singles</h2>

                <p>As mentioned, eharmony is the number one trusted dating in the U.S. This is because of our commitment to
                    on-site interactions being respectful, open-minded and honest. Our customer care team is available to handle
                    any issues while our Trust &amp; Safety team is constantly monitoring account activity and investigates any
                    complaints of unusual, inappropriate or falsified accounts.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="same">
                <h2 >Love might be closer than you think</h2>

                <p>Whether it’s a chance encounter at your local park or using eharmony to quickly establish singles near me, we
                    don’t think how you met someone is as important as the fact that you met them. So why spend another day not
                    finding that special someone nearby who is exactly right for you?&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Over our 20 years, we’ve learned a lot about what makes people happy together and how important it is to
                    match the right people. So why spend another day single? Love might be around that next corner. Come find it
                    with us on eharmony by joining for free today.</p>
